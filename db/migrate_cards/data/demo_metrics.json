This means that when these rights are respected, workers can use them to ensure that other labour standards, including a living wage, are upheld. A living wage must always be a negotiated figure. We see worker empowerment as central to this. Unfortunately, workers face many barriers to joining or forming a trade union and bargaining collectively. Many governments restrict, undermine, obstruct or even outlaw independent trade unions. Employers often express a hostile attitude toward trade unions and frequently use a range of tactics to prevent unions from emerging, including intimidation, discrimination, dismissal, blacklisting and even physical violence. Brands need to take proactive steps to help prevent these trends and ensure practical respect for freedom of association is upheld.</div>\r\n<div><br><strong>Practical steps we were looking for evidence of included:</strong></div>\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Clear communication of a policy to support freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining for all stakeholders</li>\r\n<li>Training on these rights for a significant proportion of workers and management</li>\r\n<li>Issuing the right to organise guarantee to workers and promoting the use of union access agreements with suppliers; adoption of a credible and well-used complaints mechanism</li>\r\n<li>Work to limit the use of short-term contracts, which are often a barrier to trade-union freedom.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p> </p>"

By putting a figure on the living wage, the labour cost can be calculated and embedded into pricing breakdowns, and companies can use this to be sure that suppliers are receiving enough to pay a living wage. If enough companies do this, production-country governments are given a clear signal that putting up the minimum wage to a living-wage level will not risk loss of business. The commitment to a real living-wage benchmark from companies also opens up space in wage negotiations between workers and factory owners. Currently, these negotiations often achieve very little because factory owners say they cannot pay more, due to low prices paid by buyers. But if unions or worker groups know that brands being produced in their factory have committed to a specified living-wage figure, these negotiations are opened up and a living wage becomes a possibility. </p>\r\n<p> </p>"
