The RepRisk Index value is percent-ranked against all companies in the ranking and multiplied by 0.5. (2) The second component is based on the number of environmental issues that were identified by RepRisk for each company. The environmental issues are: global pollution and climate change, local pollution, impacts on ecosystems and landscapes, overuse and wasting of resources and waste issues; the total number of environmental issues for each company is percent-ranked against all Industry Group peers in the ranking and multiplied by 0.5.
