<p>Metrics are standardised ways of measuring some aspect of a company's performance, they are a fair way of comparing companies behaviour because they ask the same questions of each company. Metrics can be numerical (e.g. 'number of employees', 'Co2 emissions') or categorical (e.g. 'conducts animal testing', 'publishes list of suppliers').</p><p></p><p>Metric values show how a company performed on the metric in a particular year. Each metric value should have a source. One of the best ways for the WikiRate community to contribute is by adding new metric values - every new value expands our knowledge about a company and makes comparison with other companies more informative.</p><p>{{Metric|add_button}}</p>
