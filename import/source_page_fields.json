It was something gone wrong on a grand scale. The birds were simply dying. It seemed like they had started rotting even while they were still alive. She and Jerry worked 10-hour days, seven days a week. Their labor seemed to do nothing but dig them deeper and deeper into debt. But the Yandells had no choice but to continue working. Their home, their farm, and their livelihood depended on whether the birds lived or not."

Now, if you interact with any of those brands online &mdash; download coupons, \"like\" or \"join\" it on Facebook, or enter a sweepstakes, for example &mdash; you give up all rights to sue the company and instead have to settle your grievances through arbitration.\nAnd General Mills isn't shying away from its new policy under scrutiny from the press. In fact, \"in language added on Tuesday after The New York Times contacted it about the changes, General Mills seemed to go even further, suggesting that buying its products would bind consumers to those terms,\" reports Stephanie Strom. Other companies, notably credit cards and cellphone services, have added similar language to their customer contracts, but a food company trying to block lawsuits is an escalation.\nWill the courts uphold General Mills' new contract? Scott L. Nelson, a Public Citizen lawyer, tells The Times that he doesn't think a judge would go along for an aggrieved customer who merely visited General Mills' website, \"but we really don't know.\" It's a pretty safe bet, he added, that \"there will be some subpoenas for computer hard drives in the future.\" Read the entire article in The New York Times."

        "content": "The Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) is today calling on Benetton to live up to their promises after an investigation conducted by the journalists of Presa Diretta, in collaboration with Campagna Abiti Puliti (CCC Italy), revealed that Benetton has violated the terms of the Bangladesh Accord, which it signed in the aftermath of the Rana Plaza tragedy, where 1138 people were killed and almost 2000 were injured when the eight story building collapsed. At the same time Benetton continues to deny compensation to workers injured in the disaster and to the families of those killed.Benetton signed the Accord in May 2013 under pressure from a worldwide campaign which generated over a million signatures. Full disclosure of all supplier factories is a basic principle of the Accord, whose objective is to ensure that all factories used by its members meet international building safety standards. The film taken by the journalists shows that at least two Benetton suppliers had not been disclosed to the Accord and did not show up on the public list of factories that will be inspected by the Accord team. By failing to disclose their suppliers Benetton not only violates this legally binding agreement but continues to put those workers at risk of yet another factory disaster.This is not the first time Benetton has failed to fulfil its obligations or public commitments in relation to this disaster. Benetton initially denied they were sourcing from one of the Rana Plaza factories last April, but were forced to acknowledge their connection after photos of their products among the rubble were published worldwide. In September 2013 Benetton joined the Rana Plaza Coordination Committee which was set up to establish a process, now known as the Arrangement, to deliver payments to those injured and the families of those killed at Rana Plaza. Despite being part of the Committee that drafting the agreement, Benetton refused to sign the Arrangement, withdrew from the Committee and to date have refused to contribute a penny to the Fund.As the labour movement worldwide approaches the first anniversary of the Rana Plaza the Campagna Abiti Puliti, along with the rest of the Clean Clothes Campaign network across Europe are demanding that Benetton change their attitude to the victims of the Rana Plaza disaster and make an immediate public donation of $5million to the Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund.Deborah Luccetti from the Campagna Abiti Puliti stated:“The Clean Clothes Campaign has full confidence that the Accord will add these suppliers to the list for inspection, but it is clear that Benetton is still not taking responsibility for the rights of the workers making their clothes”.She added:“We call on Benetton to change its attitude toward the right for victims to be fairly compensated by signing the Arrangement and making a contribution of at least 5 milion dollars into the international Trust Fund. We expert Benetton to announce it publicly by the next RP anniversary, this way leading the process to get justice for the victims. We call on the other italian brands sourcing from Rana Plaza, Manifattura Corona and Yes Zee, to do same.”It’s time to put an end to the unbelivable pain RP victims are still suffering and Campagna Abiti Puliti (CCC Italy) along with other Clean Clothes Campaigns across Europe and the US labour rights group, International Labor Rights Forum, are inviting people to join us in calling on Benetton to Pay Up!"

The cold and rainy weather may have inhibited a more massive turnout, but those who marched had a dynamic presence on the street. The march was well guarded and loud slogans resonated through the entire neighborhood. The radical and subversive tone of overthrow displaced the politically passive and submissive silence. We crossed Iera Odos (the areas central commercial avenue) with the “discreet escort” of police. Shortly before reaching Praktiker the presence of two platoons of riot police became less discreet as they took their position in front of the store.  The store had shut the large underground parking area and had stretched thick wire mesh in the facade. The demonstrators demanded the riot police squads to move away from the entrance so we got right in front of the central entrance. This had as an effect the Praktiker’s store internal doors to be locked down while the adjoining grocery store remained open. We stayed for about 20 minutes shouting slogans and distributing leaflets inside and outside the building and drew slogans and threw red paint on the facade of the store. Then we all marched to the metro station of the Agia Marina which is within a short walking distance from the Praktiker and then returned to the Estavromenos square where we had started."

Given how relatively new they are, there is little research specifically investigating how microbeads affect the environment. Still, Rochman says, there is plenty of evidence from research on other plastics suggesting that they’re probably causing more harm than good. In oceans and lakes, she says, bits of plastic “act like sponges,” soaking up toxins like pesticides and flame retardants that have also found their way into the ecosystem. And hundreds of species, from fish to plankton to wild-caught tuna, ingest bits of plastic, meaning those toxins could be ending up in the food chain."

The snow capped mountain range in the southern Andes that runs along the border of Argentina and Chile, or the Cordillera as the locals call it, is one of the most pristine in the world. Under the mountains lies flat earth filled with bushes and vegetation that sheep and cattle graze on. The gold and quartz inside the mountains of Argentina's southern province of Chubut have recently brought in mining companies such as Meridian Gold, and now Benetton, for its exploitable and vast plains - perfect for the mass production of wool.  \nTo the Mapuche Indians in southern Argentina, the Italian clothing manufacturer Benetton is the newest conquistador in 10,000 years of land struggles in Patagonia. Today Benetton is the largest landholder in Argentina, owning 900,000 hectares (2.2 million acres) in the resource-rich region of Patagonia. With 9% of Patagonia's most cultivatable land, their holdings amount to 40 times the size of the capital city of Buenos Aires, the second largest city in Latin America.\n\"Here they fenced off all that they wanted. If it was a pretty valley, for that reason they appropriated it, if it was beautiful pampas, they closed it out. They left us among the stones, among the worst fields\" says a Mapuche farmer Rogelio Fermín.\nNew Colonization of Patagonia\n\"Patagonia gives me an amazing sense of freedom,\" said Carlo Benetton when assuming ownership of the Argentinean territory. In 1997 Benetton bought out the British-owned Compania Tierras del Sur Argentina S.A. (CORP) for a total of $50 million. The records of CORP acknowledge the presence of indigenous people in the area. In return for the land that has been occupied by Mapuches for 13,000 years, Benetton constructed the Leleque museum, located in front of the Benetton estate in Chubut, to \"narrate the history and culture of a mythical land.\"\nBut Benetton's occupation of Argentina land reaps more than just a personal sense of freedom and museums of the past: Benetton's 280,000 sheep produce 6,000 tons of wool a year, 10% of the production needs of the world's biggest consumer of virgin wool.\nTwo hundred meters away from the Leleque Museum live a Mapuche family called the Curiñancos. Atilio Curiñanco was born and raised in Leleque, but later moved to neighboring Esquel. After suffering from Argentina's economic crisis in December 2001, Atilio and his wife Rosa decided to return to the fields, and attempt to grow their own food, raise animals, and establish a micro-enterprise.\n\"It all started when we proposed to start a family enterprise in Santa Rosa,\" says Atilio Curiñanco, age 52. \"I have known that land since I was born, and I saw that nobody occupied it, so we thought it would be a good opportunity.\"\nThe Curiñancos contacted the Instituto Autárquico de Colonizacion (IAC), a government-managed real estate agency, to request permission to occupy an estate called Santa Rosa, situated in front of one of Benetton's properties. The land is well known to the Mapuches as unoccupied indigenous territory and was verbally confirmed as such by IAC. After waiting 8 months, the Curiñancos hadn't received a response about the Santa Rosa property.  Finally IAC presented a note to the family saying \"information has been obtained that leads us to believe that the property is zoned commercial\" and that \"our interest is to reserve it for a micro-enterprise.\"\nThe Curiñancos showed up at the Esquel Police station in Chubut to make it known that they would occupy Santa Rosa. In the same afternoon, a group of campesinos began to work the land with the little resources they had -- plowing, sowing vegetables, and bringing in farm animals.\n\"We went to land without harming anyone,\" says Atilio Curiñanco. \"We didn't cut a fence, we didn't go at night, we didn't hide ourselves. We waited for someone to come to let us know if it bothered them, to present us with a document that the land belonged to someone, and no one ever showed up.\"\nThe local Benetton office maintained that the Santa Rosa estate was company property. Benetton issued a report claiming that the estate \"is not to be used for cattle raising\" and stated their intentions to take control of the property. After two months of land occupation, the police dismantled and seized the belongings of the Curiñanco family.\nWhen questioned about the eviction, Benetton lawyer Martin Iturburo Moneff says that the land takeover by the Mapuche family was simply a problem of \"common delinquency.\"\nThe Benetton land surrounding the Santa Rosa property continues to be unoccupied. The Curiñancos say that they will return to the land that was taken away from them, and refuse to let Benetton redraw the lines of their history. \"As indigenous people, we are going to fight until the end until this land is ours,\" says Atilio.\nEviction threats in Leleque\nAcross the dusty highway from the Santa Rosa property, Atilio's mother, 85 year-old Doña Calendaria, has to jump the fence of the Benetton property to access water from the areas only stream.\n\"The way to the Chubut River is a local road. That shouldn't be closed,\" says Laura, a resident of the region for 40 years. She describes how the area changed when Benetton bought the land in 1991. \n\"[Benetton] has three gates with keys, and to enter you have to request permission from them, and you can't fish unless you have permission, because they don't let you. Towards the end of the property there are some families, but they can't leave through the Benetton property.  They have to go around it, a 90 kilometer trip.\"\nLeleque is a village made up of eight families who worked for the Argentinean railroad company loading wool, leather and other goods for transport to the capital city. In 1992, a year after Benetton bought the surrounding property, the loading station in Leleque was closed.  \"This used to be a beautiful town, but now it looks like a graveyard,\" says Calendaria's neighbor, Pigeon Llancaqueo.\nWhen the loading station was shut down, running water for the families was cut off and police stopped serving the area. The local cemetery is now part of the Benetton estate, in the yard of the Leleque Museum. Without work, potable water or land to grow food, the Leleque residents only had their animals to help them survive. At the end of September 2003, the state passed a resolution prohibiting the Leleque residents to have animals.\nIn September of this year, the 50 Leleque residents, the majority of whom are Mapuche women and children, were told by the state-owned railroad company that they had three months to abandon their houses to make way for a tourist attraction, which would use the very houses that they occupy.\nThe tourist project, supported by the county of Chubut, involves reactivating the railway for a guided train tour of Patagonia. Although provincial officials deny that the project has any relationship with the Italian company, one of the central offers of the tour is to visit the Benetton property. The official slogan of the tourist project describes \"a true trip through the region's origins, leaving from El Maiten heading towards Leleque, where [tourists] will also visit the Museum Leleque, where one can enjoy a Patagonian asado [typical Argentine food] at the Benetton estate.\"\nUpon the eviction of the Leleque residents, a school house for 18 students will also be shut down. Although the state promises housing for the evicted residents, it is not guaranteed. \"I don't like to use the word eviction,\" says Miguel Mateo, spokesperson for the Ferrocarril Provincial del Chubut (Provincial Railroad Company of Chubut). \"It implies that the people are being thrown out into the street.\"\nIn the face of eviction, the residents of Leleque have begun to organize. They point out that the local communities have been integrated into other tourist enterprises at other train stations in the area, such as in Nehuelpan. The difference, they say, is that those stations are not surrounded by Benetton lands. \n\"Little by little, they have been closing the door on the Leleque community.  It's a very strategic plan,\" says Mauro Millan, spokesperson for Mapuche organization 11 de Octubre. \"Up until now, we have been defenseless but now we are in the era where the Mapuches are on the offensive. We have decided that there won't be any more evictions -- from the state or from Benetton.\"\nBenetton around the world\nThe Benetton Group was founded in 1965 by the Northern Italian Benetton family, which maintains a majority state in the company.  Benetton not only has clothing outlets in 120 countries, but also owns freeways, urban catering services, and telecommunications companies in Europe, and real estate and agriculture around the world. With a total of 7,000 retail stores, an annual production of 100 million garments, Benetton's average yearly revenue is 2 billion Euros. The company is famous for its controversial advertisements, depicting AIDS victims and death row inmates among other gripping images, which promote social responsibility and multiculturalism. Yet, Benetton's labor and political practices provide a stark contrast to its PR message.\nBenetton was the center of a child labor scandal in Turkey in 1998, when several children ages 11-13 were photographed working at the Bermuda Tekstil factory in Istanbul, a textile plant that produces Benetton line clothing. Turkish law and the international labor convention forbid the work of children younger than 14. Benetton suspended its dealings with the subcontractor after the violations were reveled by a Turkish trade union.\nBenetton found itself again in a storm of controversy when the Kappa Company, partially owned by Benetton, proposed a clothing-manufacturing center in the Occupied Palestinian Territories in the late 1990's. After a human rights groups campaigned against the plan, warning of its violation of international agreements set up by the Fourth Geneva Convention regarding enterprises in the OPT, Kappa finally rescinded its plan.\nJust last year, the Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering launched a boycott campaign against Benetton, for its plan to use one million Radio Frequency Identification Chips, or RFIDs, for inventory purposes in its clothing. Benetton dropped the plan after critics voiced concern that the devices placed within clothing items could potentially allow the manufacturer to track the movements of its customers.\nListen to the audio version of this story on Free Speech Radio NewsSebastian Hacher is an Argentinean independent journalist and photographer who works with Indymedia Argentina.

        "content": "Labor rights groups on Monday accused the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., of turning a blind eye to abusive conditions at a factory in China that makes plastic toys for the company. \nThe National Labor Committee and China Labor Watch said in a report that workers at the factory in Chang Ping Township in Guangdong province were paid less than the legal minimum and worked longer hours than legally allowed. \nA Wal-Mart spokesman said he was not aware of the specific allegations but that the company worked to ensure factories all over the world were run legally and inspected for abuses. \nThe report said the Chinese factory management trained workers to answer prepared questions and paid them a bonus for remembering them correctly during visits by Wal-Mart inspectors. \nIt said emergency fire exits and medical boxes were normally locked, but the Chinese managers unlocked them ahead of inspections. They also doctored time cards, the report said. \nThe rights groups said Wal-Mart appeared to condone the Chinese management's methods. \"No company could be that shallow or gullible, unless it were consciously acting out a role with the full intent of achieving the desired result -- a whitewash,\" the report said. \nBill Wertz, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, said Wal-Mart had experienced inspectors who adhered to its corporate standards. \n\"It would be a complete violation of our policy for anyone to participate in any charade that would merely make a pretense of observing a thorough inspection,\" Wertz said. \nThe rights groups said workers received an average 16.5 cents an hour when the legal minimum in China was 31 cents an hour. The workweek was seven days when five days was legal and people toiled for up to 20-1/2 hours per shift. \nThe groups said the same He Yi Electronics and Plastics Products Factory produced \"bobblehead\" sports star dolls for America's major professional sports organizations through U.S. company Fotoball. \nCharles Kernaghan, head of the National Labor Committee, said the sports organizations -- including the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Collegiate Athletic Association -- had not responded to his letters. \n\"We're hitting a stone wall with these people, which is sort of amazing, given their profits and the salaries ... the players won't be happy that their images are being made by workers in China with zero rights,\" said Kernaghan, who revealed in October that a sweatshop in Honduras made the clothing line of hip-hop music and fashion entrepreneur Sean Combs. \nKernaghan said on Monday that Combs' staff had worked with his group to greatly improve conditions in that factory.\nThis site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.
