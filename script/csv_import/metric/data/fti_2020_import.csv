Policies are a way for a company to communicate its commitments to human rights, social impacts and environmental protection. If they have policies in place we know they are considering these topics within their business.



","In this question you are being asked to identify the company's human rights and environmental policies.

Things to watch out for:
- Supplier Code of Conducts do not count toward this metric question, unless they explicitly state that they apply to the company's own employees.
- Some of the policies in this section can be found in an Employee Handbook, if publicly available, or sometimes in the Careers section of the website.
- Environmental policies are often separate company policies, not included in an Employee Handbook.
- Restricted Substance List itself must be published, not sufficient if they just say that they have a RSL in place.
- For Waste & Recycling (Textiles), we are looking specific for policies on off-cuts and textile wastage or policy on waste resulting from defective stock or production samples. 
- Equal Pay policy can sometimes be found within a discrimination policy. The discrimination policy must explicitly state that it includes pay/remuneration and gender/sex
- Biodiversity and Conservation policy can include deforestation and forest-based fibre policies
- Banning the use of any animal derived fibre isn't sufficient for points for Animal Welfare. We are looking for a policy such as the Five Freedoms approach, which covers issues such as husbandry and use of animal derived materials.
