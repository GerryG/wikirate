What do the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights expect?
A policy commitment is a statement approved at the highest levels of the business that shows the company is committed to respecting human rights and communicates this internally and externally.

Note: The term “statement” is used to de- scribe a wide range of forms a company may use to set out publicly its responsibilities, commitments, and expectations – this may be a separate human rights policy or human rights commitments within other formal policies, or provisions within other documents that govern the company’s approach such as a company code, business principles, etc.

Why is this important?
A policy commitment sets the “tone at the top” of the company that is needed to continually drive respect for human rights into the core values and culture of the business.

It indicates that top management considers respect for human rights to be a minimum standard for conducting business with legitimacy; it sets out their expectations of how staff and business relationships should act, as well as what others can expect of the company.

It should trigger a range of other internal actions that are necessary to meet the commitment in practice.";"The Company publicly commits to respecting human rights across its activities. It must be clear the commitment relates to all internationally recognised human rights, rather than to only one or more selected human rights. This only considers commitments to avoid adverse human rights impacts and does not include philanthropic commitments.

Note: Additional industry-specific commitments are considered in A.1.3

Assessing

What do the UN Guiding Principles expect?
Companies should identify and assess any negative impacts on human rights with which they may be involved.

Why is this important?
Through the process of “integration” a company can take the findings from its assessment of impacts, identify who in the company needs to be involved in addressing them, and work with them to decide on an effective response. It is through the actions it takes to prevent or mitigate impacts that the company actually reduces its impacts on people, which is central to achieving respect for human rights.";"The Company integrates the findings of its assessments of human rights risks and impacts into relevant internal functions and processes to identify appropriate actions to prevent, mitigate and/or remediate its salient human rights issues.

HUMAN RIGHTS DUE DILIGENCE
The purpose of human rights due diligence is to “know and show” that the company understands, is addressing and accountable for its impacts on specific people, communities and on the natural environment in a reasonable timeframe given its context of operations.

Tracking

What do the UN Guiding Principles expect?
Companies need to track their responses to actual and potential human rights impacts to evaluate how effectively they are being addressed. Tracking should be based on appropriate qualitative and quantitative indicators and draw on internal and external feedback, including from affected stakeholders.

Why is this important?
Tracking how well the company is managing its human rights risks is the only way the company can really know it is respecting human rights in practice. Tracking is a crucial dimension of continuous improvement – it helps the company identify trends and patterns; it highlights recurring problems that may require more systemic changes to policies or processes, as well as good practices that can be shared across the company. Tracking is also essential for the company to be able to communicate accurately to all its stakeholders about what it is doing to meet its responsibility to respect human rights.
";"The Company tracks the effectiveness of actions taken in response to its human rights risks and impacts assessed and acted on to incorporate that information into improving processes and systems on an ongoing basis.

The purpose of human rights due diligence is to “know and show” that the company understands, is addressing and accountable for its impacts on specific people, communities and on the natural environment in a reasonable timeframe given its context of operations.

Communicating

What do the UN Guiding Principles expect?
Companies need to be prepared to communicate externally in order to account for how they address their impacts, particularly when concerns are raised by, or on behalf of, affected stakeholders. Companies that may have severe human rights impacts should report formally on how they address them.

Why is this important?
It is by knowing and showing that they respect human rights in practice that companies build trust in their performance, demonstrate their reliability as partners, and gain a sustainable “social license to operate”. More widely, it is part of being accountable for how they do business, not least to those who may be impacted. Increasingly, shareholders, governments, potential business relationships, stock exchanges and civil society stakeholders also expect companies to provide information on their human rights performance.
";"The Company communicates externally how it addresses its human rights impacts in a mannerthat is accessible to its intended audiences, especially affected stakeholders who have raisedconcerns, providing enough information to evaluate the adequacy of the response(s) and doesnot pose risks to affected stakeholders or personnel.

What do the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights expect?
- Where a company identifies that it has caused or contributed to negative human rights impacts, it should provide for or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes.
- Companies should establish or participate in effective operational-level grievance mechanisms for stakeholders who may be negatively impacted by their activities.
- Remediation processes provided by the state or third-party institutions can provide alternative channels for affected stakeholders to raise complaints or concerns. Complainants should be free to choose which available channels they wish to use.

Why is this important?
- Access to effective remedy is a human right in itself and therefore a core part of respecting human rights.
- Unless a company actively engages in the remediation of impacts it has caused or contributed to, it cannot fully meet its responsibility to respect human rights.
- Negative impacts may occur despite a company’s best efforts, given the complexity of activities and business relationships involved. Companies need to be prepared for this situation they can respond quickly and effectively.
- Strong remediation processes can help prevent impacts or conflicts from increasing or escalating.

Note: See also Indicator A.1.5. on policy commitments concerning remedy and Indicator A.1.6 on policy commitments concerning human rights defenders.

Key concepts
Remediation / remedy - Both the process of providing remedy for a negative human rights impact and the substantive outcomes that can counteract, or make good, the negative impact. These outcomes may take a range of forms such as apologies, restitution, rehabilitation, financial or non-financial compensation, and punitive sanctions (whether criminal or administrative, such as fines), as well as the prevention of harm through, for example, injunctions or guarantees of non-repetition.";"The Company has one or more channel(s) or mechanism(s) (its own, third party or shared) through which workers can raise complaints or concerns, including in relation to human rights issues. The channel(s)/mechanism(s) is available to all workers and takes into account accessibility by marginalised groups.

Corporate Human Rights Benchmark;C.2 Grievance Channels / Mechanisms to Receive Complaints or Concerns from External Individuals and Communities;To what degree does the company provide channels or mechanisms through which external individuals and communities can report grievances?;"REMEDIES AND GRIEVANCE MECHANISMS

What do the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights expect?
- Where a company identifies that it has caused or contributed to negative human rights impacts, it should provide for or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes.
- Companies should establish or participate in effective operational-level grievance mechanisms for stakeholders who may be negatively impacted by their activities.
- Remediation processes provided by the state or third-party institutions can provide alternative channels for affected stakeholders to raise complaints or concerns. Complainants should be free to choose which available channels they wish to use.

Why is this important?
- Access to effective remedy is a human right in itself and therefore a core part of respecting human rights.
- Unless a company actively engages in the remediation of impacts it has caused or contributed to, it cannot fully meet its responsibility to respect human rights.
- Negative impacts may occur despite a company’s best efforts, given the complexity of activities and business relationships involved. Companies need to be prepared for this situation they can respond quickly and effectively.
- Strong remediation processes can help prevent impacts or conflicts from increasing or escalating.

Note: See also Indicator A.1.5. on policy commitments concerning remedy and Indicator A.1.6 on policy commitments concerning human rights defenders.

Key concepts
Remediation / remedy - Both the process of providing remedy for a negative human rights impact and the substantive outcomes that can counteract, or make good, the negative impact. These outcomes may take a range of forms such as apologies, restitution, rehabilitation, financial or non-financial compensation, and punitive sanctions (whether criminal or administrative, such as fines), as well as the prevention of harm through, for example, injunctions or guarantees of non-repetition.";"The Company has one or more channel(s)/mechanism(s) (its own, third party or shared) through which individuals and communities who may be adversely impacted by the Company can raise complaints/concerns, including in relation to human rights issues.

Corporate Human Rights Benchmark;E.0 Summary of allegation;;"PERFORMANCE: RESPONSES TO SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS

Which allegations will be included?
Recognising the need for companies to focus their resources on responding to severe and substantiated allegations, the following criteria will be applied to assess whether an allegation will be assessed under this Measurement Theme.

Severe impacts:
This Measurement Theme will cover allegations of severe human rights impacts. The commentary to UN Guiding Principle 14 states that ‘severity of impacts will be judged by their scale, scope and irremediable character’. The Interpretive Guide to the UN Guiding Principles provides additional information about severity. Severe negative impacts are defined in the Guiding Principles as those impacts that would be greatest in terms of:
a. Scale: The gravity of the impact on the human right(s); and/or
b. Scope: The number of individuals that are or could be affected; and/or
c. Remediability: The ease with which those impacted could be restored to their prior enjoyment of the right(s).

Clear human rights link:
The types of alleged impacts covered will include the following (see Table 17 below):
• Child Labour
• Forced Labour
• Discrimination
• Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining
• Working Hours
• Health and Safety
• Right to security of persons including
freedom from torture, cruel inhumane or degrading treatment.
• Land rights including forced displacement
• Indigenous peoples rights
• Environmental damage leading to water, land or air harmful to human health or negative impacts on livelihoods.

Recent:
Allegations must have occurred within the previous three years from the start date of the annual CHRB research period. Allegations of impacts that have taken place more than three years prior to the date of the annual CHRB research period may be included if renewed allegations arise in connection with the original allegation (for example, about a failure to provide an effective remedy).

External source:
The indicators in this Measurement Theme are based on allegations from external sources such as print media, NGOs, news sites, gov- ernmental agencies, commentaries and social media. Only sources covered by Vigeo Eiris, BHRRC and RepRisk will be considered and each source will be shared with the Companies assessed. Sources mainly include multilateral organisations, trade unions and relevant NGOs. Analysts working for BHRRC, RepRisk and Vigeo Eiris regularly monitor email listings and search global press and NGO websites for information relating to alleged breaches and the Dow Jones/Reuters Factiva service is used to source news articles. The allegations will be reviewed by these organisations and any duplicate allegations across the databases will be removed. Note that these will not consider companies’ self-reported impacts, which are dealt with in indicators under the other CHRB Measurement Themes.

Level of detail provided on the allegation:
Allegations must have enough detail to link the Company to the allegation, i.e. to put the Company’s responsibility into question if the facts were established. Such details can include specifications about specific operations or locations and specific details about the alleged impacts. A Company, or a joint venture or consortium (where the Company has an equity stake of 5% or more), must be specifically named in an allegation to be included.

Practical thresholds:
Outlined below are the indicative thresholds for including allegations in this Measurement Theme, relevant international standards and some examples to highlight the kinds of allegations that could qualify in practice.

Insert Table 17: Examples of types of alleged impacts relevant to Measurement Theme E

Number of allegations covered
In the 2016 Pilot Benchmark, a maximum of two allegations per type of impact (see the first column in Table 18) will be assessed for each Company. This is due to practical limitations. All allegations across BHRRC, Vigeo Eiris and RepRisk databases will be considered when selecting cases to assess. If there are more than two allegations recorded in these databases about a specific type of impact for a Company, allegations will be selected for scoring by prioritising according to the following criteria:
• High severity: see criteria above on scale, scope and remediability.
• Systemic nature: multiple allegations or allegation on-going for an extended period of time.
• Prior warning: abuses that were foreseeable or allegedly deliberate.
• Legal/regulatory framework: ongoing court cases, fines, judgements, formal inquiries by government departments and
regulators. In addition, regard may also be paid to the scale of coverage of the issue.
If a Company only has allegations recorded under a single type of impact, up to three allegations will be assessed under this category.

Scoring
Scoring for the Responses to Serious Allegations Measurement Theme is dealt with differently than the other Measurement Themes. The scoring operates by deducting points rather than adding them. In other words, companies without any serious allegations will receive the full score on this Measurement Theme – a maximum of eight points, which
is equal to the full weighting of this Measurement Theme (20%) in the overall scoring of
the Benchmark.
The scoring will operate according to the following rules:
• The Company’s response to each serious allegation that is assessed is scored in
indicators E.1 to E.3. Indicator E.3 is worth double points. Hence, a company receives
a score between 0-8 points per response.
• These scores per allegation are then averaged.
• The Company’s average score is weighted to convert from a 0-8 point scale to a 0-100% scale. The weighting depends on
whether the Company has multiple serious allegations as follows:
- If the Company has only 1 serious allegation, then each point in its average score is weighted 12.5%;
- If the Company has 2 serious allegations, then each point scored in its average score is weighted 10%;
- If the Company has 3 or more serious allegations, then each point in its average score is weighted 7.5%.
• In all cases, if the Company’s average score is 8 points, i.e., it has received the maximum score on all allegations, it will
score 100% on Measurement Theme E, which amounts to 20% of the overall weighting of the Benchmark.
• This is also illustrated in Table 18.

Insert Table 18: Scoring for Measurement Theme E

Actual versus potential impacts
This Measurement Theme covers allegations of actual impacts; allegations regarding potential impacts that have a likelihood of occurring in the future will not be addressed in this Measurement Theme, but in other Measurement Themes of the Benchmark. Therefore,
in the context of this Measurement Theme, ‘alleged’ refers to impacts that the company may or may not have acknowledged (i.e. de- nied that it occurred, or that it has caused or contributed to the impact).

Allegations arising during assessment
If an allegation about a company arises during the assessment period, CHRB will assess the response using a modified approach. In order to receive a Score 1 or 2, the company will have to issue a letter of commitment that it will comply with the requirements set out under each indicator.";;"E. Performance: Responses

Score 1:
The Company takes appropriate action to address the alleged impact including through providing remedy(ies) to the affected people OR by having in place related management systems to prevent such impacts depending on its ‘level of involvement’ (whether causing, contributing or directly linked - see 'Note' below) AND engages in a dialogue with the stakeholders reportedly affected in the allegation (or, if the Company is alleged to be directly linked, it encourages its business relationship to do so). If the Company denies the allegation, it engages in a dialogue with the stakeholders reportedly affected in the allegation (or, if the Company is alleged to be directly linked,it encourages its business relationship to do so).

Score 2:
The Company also provides evidence that it provides remedy(ies) that are satisfactory to the victims AND provides evidence of having improved its management systems to prevent such impacts from occurring in future AND engages in dialogue.

If the Company denies the allegation, it also provides evidence of having improved its management systems to prevent such impacts from occurring in future (the measures depending upon the potential level of involvement, whether causing, contributing or directly linked).

Note:
A Company is expected to take appropriate action to respond to impacts under the UN Guiding Principles where a Company identifies that they have caused or contributed to adverse human rights impacts. This varies according to the ‘level of involvement’ in an impact:

• where the Company identifies it has caused or may cause an adverse human rights impact, it should take the necessary steps to cease or prevent the impact and provide for or cooperate in remediation through legitimate processes.

• where the Company identifies that it has contributed or may contribute to an adverse human rights impact, it should take the necessary steps to cease or prevent its contribution, use its leverage to mitigate any remaining impact to the greatest extent possible, and provide for or cooperate in remediation through legitimate processes.

• where a Company identifies that it has not caused or contributed to an adverse human rights impact, but that impact is nevertheless directly linked to its operations, products or services by its business relationship with another entity, the Company should seek to prevent and mitigate the impact and may take a role in remediation.
